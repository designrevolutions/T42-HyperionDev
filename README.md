## Description

We were assigned a task to create a HTML website where we had manay pages that were linked - to showcase being able to develop a responsive website, in task 35.
In task 42, we were asked to make additions to demonstrate usage of localStorage in Javascript.
We needed to make web pages where the end user could like, save pages and add comments - just to demonstrate the usage of being able to save data and keept it persistent.

## Installation

Just unzip all files into a directory. 

## Usage

The HTML works on it's own. Data is saved in your browser storage allocation for the HTML files. So just launch th HTML file.

## Screenshots

See below for screenshots of the code in action

## Credits

Developed by Omar Miah. 2 hours of coding needed + 10 hours if fixing silly bugs and learning more about how to code in Javascript.
