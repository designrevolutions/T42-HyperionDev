<!-- I got the main code part from here: https://codepen.io/kevinpowell/pen/PWNwZm
I wanted a hamburger mobile icom on the top right and wanted to avoid having 2 sets of navigations - all examples I could find had 2 sets of navigations
This one has one set of naviation - so if making changes, it will be easier to fix -->

          In 20 years, Andy has a made a one man band business selling fried
          donuts. This has evolved into churros - born in Brazil, similar to
          doughnuts but long with an empty centre that can be filled with
          fillings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Andy has crafted and blended to make his own secret recipe. He sells
          on his website
          <a href="https://candidonut.com" target="_blank">Candi Donut</a> and
          targets wholesale customers.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The challenge:</strong> take Andy's business and sell to
          retail. Currently he runs a trailer, van and shop - all by himself.
          He's not selling directly to Joe Public. We can enhance his reach to
          wholesale customers and target directly through advertising.
          Currently, his business comes mostly as a result of word of mouth.
