<!-- I got the main code part from here: https://codepen.io/kevinpowell/pen/PWNwZm
I wanted a hamburger mobile icom on the top right and wanted to avoid having 2 sets of navigations - all examples I could find had 2 sets of navigations
This one has one set of naviation - so if making changes, it will be easier to fix -->

          Adel has developed his dream of a business in Norwegian Balance. The
          supplements come the Norwegian Sea and not from farmed fishes. This
          makes a world of a difference in quality. He's partnered with a
          leading pharmaceutical in Norway to develop the product over the
          course of years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adel is a trained doctor and has innate knowledge of ingredients the
          body needs. He sells on his website
          <a href="https://www.norwegianbalance.com/" target="_blank"
            >Norwegian Balance</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The Challenge:</strong> to introduce Norwegian Balance to the
          world. Currently, Adel is generating sales by himself. He's an expert
          at what he does - but not an expert when it comes to running a
          business online or offline.
